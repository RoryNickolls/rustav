Old Method (Hash everything!! don't do this again):
50MB File 1 Signature = 13 minutes

New Method (Search for first byte before hashing):
50MB File 1 Signature = 58 seconds

New New Method (Search for first and second byte before hashing):
50MB File 1 Signature = 15 seconds

For a 50GB file, this method will take 4 hours per signature (way too long)
